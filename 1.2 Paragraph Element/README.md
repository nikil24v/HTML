# HTML Paragraph Elements Demo

This project demonstrates the use of the **HTML `<p>` (paragraph) element** to structure and display blocks of textual content on a webpage.

---

## Description

The document contains multiple paragraphs written using the `<p>` tag. Each paragraph represents a separate block of text, ensuring proper spacing, readability, and semantic meaning in HTML.

Lorem Ipsum text is used as **placeholder content**, which is a common practice during web design and development before final content is available.
